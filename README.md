This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router v6. The problem arises when the catch-all route interferes with other defined routes, leading to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior.  The solution involves carefully ordering routes and potentially using more specific catch-all routes to resolve conflicts.  The `App.js` file shows the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
